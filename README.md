# 311Program4--Sorting

This program reads int data from files, sorts the data, and outputs the sorted data to txt files.
It sorts using quickSort, mergeSort, and heapSort for each file, and outputs the sorting time for each.
For the purposes of this assignment, we're sorting identical data from three input files to test different cases:
dataAscend.txt	<- Data is already sorted in ascending order
dataDescend.txt	<- Data is in descending order
dataRandom.txt	<- Data is in random order
